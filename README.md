# Governed & Auditable AI Content Pipeline (Part 2)

This is a reliable, auditable, and schema-validated content generation pipeline with a FastAPI backend and SQLite database persistence. It extends the original system with strict Pydantic schemas, quantitative reviewer evaluation, and a bounded refiner/tagger flow.

## Agent Roles
1. **Generator Agent**: Produces the initial draft educational content (explanation, MCQs, learning objectives, and common misconceptions) for a given grade and topic. Validates output structure against a strict Pydantic schema and retries once if validation fails.
2. **Reviewer Agent (Gatekeeper)**: Evaluates the content quantitatively across four metrics (Age Appropriateness, Correctness, Clarity, and Coverage) on a 1-5 scale. Enforces the pass threshold (all scores must be >= 4) and provides field-specific critiques.
3. **Refiner Agent**: Receives a failed draft and the reviewer's critiques, producing a revised version focusing on resolving the specified issues.
4. **Tagger Agent**: Classifies final approved content into metadata parameters (subject, topic, grade, difficulty, content type, and Bloom's Taxonomy level).

## Pass/Fail Criteria
- **Pass Threshold**: All evaluation categories (Age Appropriateness, Correctness, Clarity, Coverage) must score **4 or 5**. 
- If any score is **< 4**, the run fails and enters the refinement loop.

## Orchestration Decisions
- **RunArtifact**: Every execution produces a single complete audit trail logging the inputs, timestamps, intermediate refinement attempts, scores, drafts, final decision, and tags.
- **Bounded Refinements**: Refinement is strictly capped at a **maximum of 2 attempts**. If the content does not pass the quality threshold by then, its final status is marked as `rejected`.

## Trade-offs
- **LLM-calculated vs. Python-enforced Thresholds**: The Python database/pipeline layer enforces the pass threshold mathematically (`all(score >= 4 for score in scores)`) rather than relying on the LLM to write the correct `pass` boolean. This prevents mismatch bugs.
- **JSON Mode with Pydantic vs. Free Text**: All agent invocations on Groq (`llama-3.3-70b-versatile`) use `response_format={"type": "json_object"}` alongside Pydantic models. This ensures extremely high structure determinism.

## Installation & Running

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configure API Key**:
   Create a `.env` file or export your Groq key:
   ```bash
   export GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   Open **http://localhost:5000** to view the UI.

4. **Run Tests**:
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/test_pipeline.py -v
   ```
